# Shell Engine (Expanded)
This branch hosts an expanded version of the Shell Game Engine, provided to us as part of the Software Architecture for Games module by our module tutor and the engine's author, Chris Rook. The base version, as provided, is on the `base_shell` branch. This branch has all changes made to it by me for this project.

See the Readme on the `main` branch for full description of the project and this engine.
